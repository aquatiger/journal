# journal

This is a journal of my programming journey.

## 11Apr18
Finished lessons of Section 8. Did three of the exercises. Went to Strategies for Success workshop.

## 10Apr18
Did a few lessons in Section 8 thought I would get further, but I have to go to Strategies for Success
workshop, then an interview, and then Kids Coding Club where I volunteer to teach children coding.

## 9Apr18
Had to journal today, and I don't really want to get too personal, but a bad night sleep with Strategies
for Success workshop and then much to do afterwards, just did not get around to coding today. Such is life
and not excuses.

## 6Apr18
Finished Section 7. Enjoyed all of them and finished them with minimal errors or problems. A change from
Section 6. And I did a little extra on some of the exercises as well. A good day of coding.

## 5Apr18
Worked on Section 7 and the first 3 exercises. These exercises, as I look ahead, seem exciting and I'm
looking forward again to finishing these and building my skills. Strategies for Success workshop again.

## 4Apr18
Finished Section 6 for LaunchCode, looking forward to Section 7

## 3Apr18
Very difficult day. Did workshop.

## 2Apr18
Continued working on Section 6 for LaunchCode. Went to Strategies for Success workshop.
A very busy day.

## 30Mar18
Had a one-way video interview for an internship. Worked on Section 6 for LaunchCode.

## 29Mar18
Continued to work on Section 6 for LaunchCode. Looked for housing and some interview issues came up.
Very busy and the exercises in Section 6 seem oddly difficult.

## 28Mar18
Worked on and finished Section 5, and did most of Section 6. I'm particularly proud today of the
way "pi approximation" and "sine wave" and "turtle circle" turned out.

## 27Mar18
Worked on and finished Section 4, and did most of Section 5 for LaunchCode, which included a bunch
of turtle exercises. Great fun!


## 26Mar18
Finished Section 3 for LaunchCode; met with WorkSource for some housing options and DSHS for food

## 23Mar18

Finished Section 2 for LaunchCode; talked to a few people at WorkSource about time management
and benefits options.

## 22Mar18

Finished Section 2; went to a meetup for data scientists; continued Strategies for Success;
worked on a couple of small programs.

## 21Mar18

Up until now I've tried to do exercises to refresh my skills I acquired at a coding bootcamp.
I finished 6 chapters of my Python book and as timing would have it I received an email from
LauchCode that I was accepted, but I needed more developed skills. So now I'm continuing to
code, but it doesn't show on github, so today I decided to journal my journey.

Today has been working on Section 2 of the skill development for LauchCode. I continue to do this
to be complete even though it is a review of basics and what I learned in coding bootcamp and
my Python book.

Today I go to a meetup after going to a 3 hour workshop. Today is very busy.

Tasks I need to do: figure out how to find something I can contribute to.
