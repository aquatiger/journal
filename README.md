# journal

This is a journal of my programming journey.

## 21Jun18
Unfortunately, I cannot find the exercises for Section 16, therefore I had to redo them all today. I started on the exercises for Section 17 today also. Frustrating, but probably happens in the real world, too.

## 20Jun18
Finished Section 16, except for one exercise, and began Section 17.

## 19Jun18
Got a lot of work done today. Looking forward to continuing to work on classes. Finished a few more exercises in Section 15 and all but 3 on Section 16.

## 18Jun18
Struggled with recursion in Section 15.

## 15Jun18
Finished reading Section 15. Recursion is a little hard at the beginning. Expecting it to get easier. Need to finish the exercises.

## 14Jun18
Finished Section 14 and started on Section 15. Looking forward to recursion.

## 13Jun18
Job interview, pretty much all day.

## 12Jun18
Finally completed everything about dictionaries. Feel good about that. Learned a lot. Started the lengthy section 14 on tkinter, got halfway. Feel good about that.

## 11Jun18
Finally finished the dictionary problem I've had for a year. The problem given in LaunchCode was not the one I've been working on for a year, but I never got a similar problem at coding bootcamp to work. Today I finished the problem, finished section 13, started section 14, prepared for a job interview, started translation program from English to Pirate. I will revisit the dictionary problem so I can learn from what happened.

## 7Jun18
Worked on the problem in Section 12 that has stumped me for almost a year. Not finished yet with it, but I have learned a lot.

## 6Jun18
Finished Section 11 with the help of tutor@python.org. Have tried to get help on Section 12, but nothing I can understand or I can accomplish, so I decided to start fron scratch.

## 5Jun18
Continued working on Section 11.

## 4Jun18
Got a good chunk of time to learn and write code today. Finished one problem, having a turtle draw a line based on input from a text file and plot the input.

## 1Jun18
Not to turn this into a diary, but personal life overwhelms again.

## 30May18
Finally got time to work on LaunchCode. I worked on one problem in Section 11 that I had skipped over and made great progress, although not complete. I requested help from some local coders for the exercise in Section 12 that seems to stump me. Also worked on networking with some companies.

## 29May18
Wow! Lost a week and a holiday. Picking things back up on Section 12 for Launch Code. Continue to take more time and make connections. Hopefully something will come of it.

## 18May18
Lots of networking today.

## 17May18
Strategies for Success. Lots of time taken.

## 16May18
Strategies for Success workshop with extra work to do tonight after the workshop.

## 15May18
Strategies for Success for Success workshop and Kids Coding Club tonight.

## 14May18
Was a rough weekend beginning on Thursday. This week however, is my final module of the Strategies for Success workshop. I'm continuing to make every effort to code.

## 9May18
Continued to work on LaunchCode. This is the lesson I got stuck on at coding bootcamp, so it is slow going.

## 8May18
Worked on LaunchCode, dictionaries, files. Kids Coding Club in the evening.

## 7May18
Networking day with a little learning about dictionaries. Again, doesn't really show up on github, but still a productive day for soft skills.

## 4May18
Did things today to further my programming career, but which does not show up on github.

## 3May18
Strategies for Success workshop. And not to turn this into a diary, but Mom fell and that took some time as well to deal with.

## 2May18
Strategies for Success.

## 1May18
Continued Strategies for Success and Kids Coding Club.

## 30Apr18
Busy trying to catch up from being sick. Strategies for Success all this week. 

## 27Apr18
Still sick.

## 25Apr18
Sick.

## 23Apr18
Accomplished a lot today also. Finished Section 11 and all but 2 exercises.
Finished lessons of Section 12, but none of the exercises.

## 20Apr18
Accomplished much. Finished exercises in Section 10. Looking forward to the rest.

## 19Apr18
Not feeling all that great today, but managed to make what I consider good progress.
Finished Section 9 and all the lessons of 10 with one or two exercises finished.

## 18Apr18
Doctor's appointment today, but I managed to finish most of the exercises in Section 9.

## 17Apr18
Finished Section 8 and the lessons of Section 9.

## 16Apr18
Not feeling well today although I accomplished a little coding. Maybe tomorrow

## 13Apr18
Called in sick. Not to turn this into a personal journal, but life happens. I've had a lot of good and
bad stress these past two weeks coupled with being around a sick person, my resistance fell.

## 12Apr18
Yet another busy day with coding and Strategies for Success workshop. A little more done on Section 8.

## 11Apr18
Finished lessons of Section 8. Did three of the exercises. Went to Strategies for Success workshop.

## 10Apr18
Did a few lessons in Section 8 thought I would get further, but I have to go to Strategies for Success
workshop, then an interview, and then Kids Coding Club where I volunteer to teach children coding.

## 9Apr18
Had to journal today, and I don't really want to get too personal, but a bad night sleep with Strategies
for Success workshop and then much to do afterwards, just did not get around to coding today. Such is life
and not excuses.

## 6Apr18
Finished Section 7. Enjoyed all of them and finished them with minimal errors or problems. A change from
Section 6. And I did a little extra on some of the exercises as well. A good day of coding.

## 5Apr18
Worked on Section 7 and the first 3 exercises. These exercises, as I look ahead, seem exciting and I'm
looking forward again to finishing these and building my skills. Strategies for Success workshop again.

## 4Apr18
Finished Section 6 for LaunchCode, looking forward to Section 7

## 3Apr18
Very difficult day. Did workshop.

## 2Apr18
Continued working on Section 6 for LaunchCode. Went to Strategies for Success workshop.
A very busy day.

## 30Mar18
Had a one-way video interview for an internship. Worked on Section 6 for LaunchCode.

## 29Mar18
Continued to work on Section 6 for LaunchCode. Looked for housing and some interview issues came up.
Very busy and the exercises in Section 6 seem oddly difficult.

## 28Mar18
Worked on and finished Section 5, and did most of Section 6. I'm particularly proud today of the
way "pi approximation" and "sine wave" and "turtle circle" turned out.

## 27Mar18
Worked on and finished Section 4, and did most of Section 5 for LaunchCode, which included a bunch
of turtle exercises. Great fun!


## 26Mar18
Finished Section 3 for LaunchCode; met with WorkSource for some housing options and DSHS for food

## 23Mar18

Finished Section 2 for LaunchCode; talked to a few people at WorkSource about time management
and benefits options.

## 22Mar18

Finished Section 2; went to a meetup for data scientists; continued Strategies for Success;
worked on a couple of small programs.

## 21Mar18

Up until now I've tried to do exercises to refresh my skills I acquired at a coding bootcamp.
I finished 6 chapters of my Python book and as timing would have it I received an email from
LauchCode that I was accepted, but I needed more developed skills. So now I'm continuing to
code, but it doesn't show on github, so today I decided to journal my journey.

Today has been working on Section 2 of the skill development for LauchCode. I continue to do this
to be complete even though it is a review of basics and what I learned in coding bootcamp and
my Python book.

Today I go to a meetup after going to a 3 hour workshop. Today is very busy.

Tasks I need to do: figure out how to find something I can contribute to.
