# journal

This is a journal of my programming journey.

## 29Mar18
Continued to work on Section 6 for LaunchCode. Looked for housing and some interview issues came up.
Very busy and the exercises in Section 6 seem oddly difficult.

## 28Mar18
Worked on and finished Section 5, and did most of Section 6. I'm particularly proud today of the
way "pi approximation" and "sine wave" and "turtle circle" turned out.

## 27Mar18
Worked on and finished Section 4, and did most of Section 5 for LaunchCode, which included a bunch
of turtle exercises. Great fun!


## 26Mar18
Finished Section 3 for LaunchCode; met with WorkSource for some housing options and DSHS for food

## 23Mar18

Finished Section 2 for LaunchCode; talked to a few people at WorkSource about time management
and benefits options.

## 22Mar18

Finished Section 2; went to a meetup for data scientists; continued Strategies for Success;
worked on a couple of small programs.

Up until now I've tried to do exercises to refresh my skills I acquired at a coding bootcamp.
I finished 6 chapters of my Python book and as timing would have it I received an email from
LauchCode that I was accepted, but I needed more developed skills. So now I'm continuing to
code, but it doesn't show on github, so today I decided to journal my journey.

Today has been working on Section 2 of the skill development for LauchCode. I continue to do this
to be complete even though it is a review of basics and what I learned in coding bootcamp and
my Python book.

Today I go to a meetup after going to a 3 hour workshop. Today is very busy.

Tasks I need to do: figure out how to find something I can contribute to.
