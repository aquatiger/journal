# journal

This is a journal of my programming journey.

##21Mar18

Up until now I've tried to do exercises to refresh my skills I acquired at a coding bootcamp.
I finished 6 chapters of my Python book and as timing would have it I received an email from
LauchCode that I was accepted, but I needed more developed skills. So now I'm continuing to
code, but it doesn't show on github, so today I decided to journal my journey.

Today has been working on Chapter 2 of the skill development for LauchCode. I continue to do this
to be complete even though it is a review of basics and what I learned in coding bootcamp and
my Python book.

Today I go to a meetup after going to a 3 hour workshop. Today is very busy.

Tasks I need to do: figure out how to find something I can contribute to.
