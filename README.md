## 25Oct18
Yesterday being filled, including project for PDX Wildlife, initiated from a meetup. Planning on working on the database aspect of the project in Python and SQL.

## 23Oct18
Way longer hiatus than desired. For the past two days I worked on the database structure for the database project for the meetup. A real live project I'm excited about. As it will eventually be an open source application, more green squares to come!

## 12Oct18
Still did not get virtualenv working. This is holding up the whole project and nowI have the meetup project to get involved with also. Planning on next week going better than this.

## 11Oct18
Longer hiatus than expected. Way too busy with formidable problems that certainly don't show up on github. Problems with github and other things that are supposed to help. Git-it, Git Bash, a usually helpful teacher whose video I just couldn't figure out.

## 5Oct18
Attempted setting up my virtual env for my project. Went fairly unsuccessfully. Applied for some jobs. Experimented with how to parse the data. Still need the Flask tutorial for me and the meetup coming up on Wednesday

## 3Oct18
Worked on Flask, job applications, worked on opening files for the project, researched pandas a little bit, continued git-it.

## 2Oct18
Was sick for awhile. Worked on git-it (frustrating), and Flask.

## 18Sep18
Mostly set up git and github stuff today. Continued planning the project.

## 17Sep18
Continued getting the project ready and planning on what to do. Combed the web for answers that seem simple enough, but unsuccessfully answered.

Continued to work on my project and a smaller program of fractions. 

## 13Aug18
Rough last week. Today I fixed a problem with Community PyCharm that I had. I started planning my project. Researched blockchain companies and other related queries. Tried to get further on my fractions program.

## 7Aug18
Today I worked on LaunchCode and better understanding Git, actually. Worked on image in LinkedIn and continued coding even though again, it doesn't reflect well on GitHub.

## 6Aug18
A busy hiatus. Worked on LaunchCode material and a greater command line proficiency.

## 31Jul18
Again worked more on soft skills, but was still productive today as well as the rest of the week, as of now, is devoted to coding and my  hard skillset.

## 30Jul18
Worked on more soft skills today rather than hard skills, but still being productive.

Finished Part 2 for LaunchCode. Questioned StackOverflow. Finished a problem that was bothering me for awhile. Looking forward to Part 3 which is my project for LaunchCode.

## 25Jul18
Contued to work on LaunchCode part 2. Tried multiple things on some programs I already wrote. Another productive day.

## 24Jul18
Continued to work on more complex programming that often does not show up on github. Started local host 8000. Questioned StackOverflow. All in all a productive day.

## 23Jul18
Worked on JS, CSS HTML on various exercises. Finished a simple calculator. Today was productive.

## 20Jul18
Worked on JS, CSS HTML on various exercises. Fairly productive but the one took me "all" day. Asked another question via StackOverflow. Did not make my goal this week because I have 3 more exercises to finish, but still great progress.

## 19Jul18
Worked on JavaScript for LaunchCode today. Definitely productive. Signed up for StackOverflow today. That was definitely an experience.

## 17Jul18

## 27Jun18
Soft skills were king again today.

## 26Jun18
Continued focusing on soft skills and companies.

## 25Jun18
Focusing on soft skills today and tomorrow to plan ahead and further my career. Many good things are happening, but not really involving coding directly.

## 22Jun18
Today I finished the final exercise in the final chapter for LaunchCode. I will continue on this path, but what a hard earned success.

## 21Jun18
Unfortunately, I cannot find the exercises for Section 16, therefore I had to redo them all today. I started on the exercises for Section 17 today also. Frustrating, but probably happens in the real world, too.

## 20Jun18
Finished Section 16, except for one exercise, and began Section 17.

## 19Jun18
Got a lot of work done today. Looking forward to continuing to work on classes. Finished a few more exercises in Section 15 and all but 3 on Section 16.

## 18Jun18
Struggled with recursion in Section 15.

## 15Jun18

## 14Jun18
Finished Section 14 and started on Section 15. Looking forward to recursion.

## 13Jun18
Job interview, pretty much all day.

## 12Jun18
Finally completed everything about dictionaries. Feel good about that. Learned a lot. Started the lengthy section 14 on tkinter, got halfway. Feel good about that.

## 11Jun18
Finally finished the dictionary problem I've had for a year. The problem given in LaunchCode was not the one I've been working on for a year, but I never got a similar problem at coding bootcamp to work. Today I finished the problem, finished section 13, started section 14, prepared for a job interview, started translation program from English to Pirate. I will revisit the dictionary problem so I can learn from what happened.

## 7Jun18
Worked on the problem in Section 12 that has stumped me for almost a year. Not finished yet with it, but I have learned a lot.

## 6Jun18
Finished Section 11 with the help of tutor@python.org. Have tried to get help on Section 12, but nothing I can understand or I can accomplish, so I decided to start fron scratch.

## 5Jun18
Continued working on Section 11.

## 4Jun18
Got a good chunk of time to learn and write code today. Finished one problem, having a turtle draw a line based on input from a text file and plot the input.

## 1Jun18
Not to turn this into a diary, but personal life overwhelms again.

## 30May18
Finally got time to work on LaunchCode. I worked on one problem in Section 11 that I had skipped over and made great progress, although not complete. I requested help from some local coders for the exercise in Section 12 that seems to stump me. Also worked on networking with some companies.

## 29May18
Wow! Lost a week and a holiday. Picking things back up on Section 12 for Launch Code. Continue to take more time and make connections. Hopefully something will come of it.

## 18May18
Lots of networking today.

## 17May18
Strategies for Success. Lots of time taken.

## 14May18
Was a rough weekend beginning on Thursday. This week however, is my final module of the Strategies for Success workshop. I'm continuing to make every effort to code.

## 9May18
Continued to work on LaunchCode. This is the lesson I got stuck on at coding bootcamp, so it is slow going.

## 8May18
Worked on LaunchCode, dictionaries, files. Kids Coding Club in the evening.

## 7May18
Networking day with a little learning about dictionaries. Again, doesn't really show up on github, but still a productive day for soft skills.

## 4May18
Did things today to further my programming career, but which does not show up on github.

## 3May18

## 17Apr18
Finished Section 8 and the lessons of Section 9.

## 16Apr18
Not feeling well today although I accomplished a little coding. Maybe tomorrow

## 13Apr18
Called in sick. Not to turn this into a personal journal, but life happens. I've had a lot of good and
bad stress these past two weeks coupled with being around a sick person, my resistance fell.

## 12Apr18
Yet another busy day with coding and Strategies for Success workshop. A little more done on Section 8.

## 11Apr18
Finished lessons of Section 8. Did three of the exercises. Went to Strategies for Success workshop.

## 10Apr18
Did a few lessons in Section 8 thought I would get further, but I have to go to Strategies for Success
workshop, then an interview, and then Kids Coding Club where I volunteer to teach children coding.

## 9Apr18
Had to journal today, and I don't really want to get too personal, but a bad night sleep with Strategies
for Success workshop and then much to do afterwards, just did not get around to coding today. Such is life
and not excuses.

## 6Apr18
Finished Section 7. Enjoyed all of them and finished them with minimal errors or problems. A change from
Section 6. And I did a little extra on some of the exercises as well. A good day of coding.

## 5Apr18
Worked on Section 7 and the first 3 exercises. These exercises, as I look ahead, seem exciting and I'm
looking forward again to finishing these and building my skills. Strategies for Success workshop again.

## 4Apr18
Finished Section 6 for LaunchCode, looking forward to Section 7

## 3Apr18
Very difficult day. Did workshop.

## 2Apr18
Continued working on Section 6 for LaunchCode. Went to Strategies for Success workshop.
A very busy day.

## 30Mar18
Had a one-way video interview for an internship. Worked on Section 6 for LaunchCode.

## 29Mar18
Continued to work on Section 6 for LaunchCode. Looked for housing and some interview issues came up.
Very busy and the exercises in Section 6 seem oddly difficult.

## 28Mar18
Worked on and finished Section 5, and did most of Section 6. I'm particularly proud today of the
way "pi approximation" and "sine wave" and "turtle circle" turned out.

## 27Mar18
Worked on and finished Section 4, and did most of Section 5 for LaunchCode, which included a bunch
of turtle exercises. Great fun!


## 26Mar18
Finished Section 3 for LaunchCode; met with WorkSource for some housing options and DSHS for food

## 23Mar18

Finished Section 2 for LaunchCode; talked to a few people at WorkSource about time management
and benefits options.

## 22Mar18

Finished Section 2; went to a meetup for data scientists; continued Strategies for Success;
worked on a couple of small programs.

## 21Mar18

Up until now I've tried to do exercises to refresh my skills I acquired at a coding bootcamp.
I finished 6 chapters of my Python book and as timing would have it I received an email from
LauchCode that I was accepted, but I needed more developed skills. So now I'm continuing to
code, but it doesn't show on github, so today I decided to journal my journey.

Today has been working on Section 2 of the skill development for LauchCode. I continue to do this
to be complete even though it is a review of basics and what I learned in coding bootcamp and
my Python book.

Today I go to a meetup after going to a 3 hour workshop. Today is very busy.

Tasks I need to do: figure out how to find something I can contribute to.
